/** \brief Swizzle mask
 *
 *
 * The swizzle mask is a 64-bit word that determines how to swizzle the logical
 * address to obtain the physical address. The swizzle mask is a binary number
 * with 4 parts of interleaving consecutive 1s and 0s.
 *
 * The swizzle mask is encoded as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * 0bpppp_pppp_pppp_ffff_ffff_ffbb_bbbb_bbbb_bbbc_cccc_cccc_cccc_cccc_cccc_cccc
 * ```
 *
 * The number of elements in p, f, b, and c is not fixed. Instead, these
 * consecutive bits are counted to obtain each value
 *
 * The 4 parts are of the swizzle mask are:
 *
 * * c = Size of the block. It is used to determine how big a single block is in
 * by using 2^C where C is the number of consecutive bits in c
 * * b = Number of nodes. It is used to determine how many nodes are part of the
 * current segment using the equation 2^B where B is the number of consecutive
 * bits in b
 * * f = Filling bits. It is used to determine the size of p based on the
 * equation P = 64-(C+B+F). This is, these bits are not used.
 * * p = Number of physical address bits that are left untouched.
 *
 *
 * For example, if we have the value
 *
 * ```
 * 0b0000_0000_0000_0011_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1001_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111
 *   |<-------------->|<------------------------->|<>|<--------------------------->|
 *      p = [63:51]          f = [50:28]       b = [27:26]      c = [25:0]
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, by counting the number of consecutive 1s and 0s we can obtain
 * P = size(p) = 13,
 * F = size(f) = 23,
 * B = size(b) = 2,
 * C = size(c) = 26

/** \brief Global Segment Description
 *
 * This class describes a single global segment. A global segment is a
 * description that determines the distribution of data across multiple
 * nodes. The global segment manager will have multiple descriptions like this
 * one of different data distributions.
 *
 * A global segment has three address spaces representation. A virtual
 * representation that is exposed to the application process. A logical
 * representation that is also consecutive but it is divided into a set of
 * blocks. And a physical representation that is how the blocks are distributed
 * across the nodes.
 *
 * For example, an application may see memory from 0xFFFFF to 0x10FFF as a
 * plain virtual address space. The same data will have a logical representation
 * of 10 blocks of 4KB each starting at address 0xBB of the logical address
 * space. Block 1 will go from 0xBB to 0xBB + 4KB. Block 2 will go from 0xBB +
 * 4KB to 0xBB + 8KB. And so on. Finally, the physical representation will not
 * be contiguous, and its distribution is parametrized by a segment descriptor.
 * If we assume that data is distributed in 3 nodes, then the blocks will be
 * distributed across these three nodes in a round-robin fashion. Therefore,
 * Node 1 will have blocks 0, 3, 6 and 9; Node 2 will have blocks 1, 4, and 7;
 * and Node 3 will have blocks 2, 5, and 8.
 *
 * The global segment descriptor has the following fields
 *
 * 1. Virtual Base Address: Determines the location of the first byte in the
 * virtual address space of the process
 * 2. Virtual Limit: Determines the location of the last byte in the virtual
 * address
 * 3. Swizzle Mask: Determines how to swizzle the virtual address to obtain the
 * physical address. This will be explained below.
 * 4. Physical Base Address: Determines the location of the first byte in the
 * physical address space. This includes the node id and the node offset.
 * 5. Access Flags: Determines the access rights of the segment.
 *
 * ## Translating virtual to logical address
 *
 * The virtual address is translated to a logical address by subtracting the
 * virtual base address from the virtual address. The virtual limit is used for
 * bounds checking (security). The discussion below uses the logical address
 * space.
 *
 * ## Physical Base Address
 *
 * Global segments may start at any node, and at any offset within that node.
 * The physical base address (encoded in physical_base_t) is a 64-bit
 * word that contains the node id and node offset of the first byte of the
 * segment. The physical base address is used to determine the final physical
 * address from a given offset.
 *
 * ## Swizzle Address
 *
 * This assumes that we have a swizzle mask. See the documentation for
 * swizzle_mask_t to understand swizzle masks
 *
 * The Swizzled Address is obtained by splitting a logical address into 3
 * parts.
 *
 * | Padding | Block Number | Block Offset |
 * |--- P ---|----- B ------|----- C ------|
 *
 * The block offset is the offset within the block in the physical memory once
 * the block and node have been identified.
 *
 * Blocks are numbered in order, starting at 0 and increasing by 1 with each
 * block. Block numbers do not consider the node each block belongs to. This is,
 * the block number is the ID of the block in the logical address space.
 *
 * For example imagine we have 10 blocks distributed over 2 nodes. There will
 * be 5 blocks per node. However, each block will have a unique block number
 * starting from 0 to 9. The block number is used to determine the node and
 * block offset.
 *
 * To calculate the bits that form the block number we use P and C from the
 * swizzle mask
 *
 * BlockNumber = Addr[63-P:C]
 *
 * Once we have the block number, we can calculate the node offset and the block
 * number within that node.
 *
 * NodeOffset = BlockNumber % NumberOfNodes
 * BlockNumberInNode = BlockNumber / NumberOfNodes
 *
 * The final swizzled address is obtained by concatenating the following:
 *
 * 1. The padding bits of the original address (i.e., Addr[63:63-P] are left
 *    untouched.
 * 2. Add the node offset.
 * 3. Add the offset to the block number within the node.
 * 4. Add the block offset.
 *
 * The final swizzled address is given by:
 *
 * SwizzledAddress = paddingBits | nodeOffset | BlockNumberInBlock*SizeOfBlock +
 *                                              BlockOffset
 *
 * Where | is the concatenation operator for each bit field.
 *
 * The structure of the physical base address was as follows:
 * | 63 - 51 | 50 - 37 | 36 - 0 |
 * |  resrvd |  nodeId |  addr  |
 *
 * Therefore, we must shift the node number to the left by 37 bits.
 *
 * The swizzled address is then given by:
 *
 * SwizzledAddress = Addr[63:63-P] << (P-63) +
 *                   (NodeOffset << 37) +
 *                   (BlockNumberInNode*SizeBlock) +
 *                    BlockOffset
 *
 * Resolving this expression we obtain:
 *
 * SwizzledAddress = Addr[63:63-P] << (P-63) +
 *                   (BlockNumber % NumberOfNodes << 37) +
 *                   ((BlockNumber / NumberOfNodes)*SizeBlock) +
 *                    BlockOffset
 *
 * And Replacing these values based on the elements from the swizzle mask we
 * obtain:
 *
 * SwizzledAddress = Addr[63:63-P] << P + Addr[63-P:C] % 2^B << 37 +
 * (Addr[63-P:C] / 2^B << C) + Addr[C-1:0]
 *
 * Therefore, the final address is given by:
 *
 * SwizzledAddress[50:37] gives the node offset
 * SwizzledAddress[36:0] gives the physical address offset
 *
 * Once we have the SwizzledAddress, we can obtain the final address by
 * including the physical_base address. This is achieved by adding the base node
 * to the node offset, and the base address to the physical address offset.
 *
 * PhysicalAddress = PhysicalBase + SwizzledAddress
 *
 * Putting it all together, the algorithm to obtain the physical address from
 * the virtual address is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Validate the virtual address is within the virtual limit:
 * (virtual_base <= virtual_address < virtual_limit) && valid(access_flags)
 * 2. Calculate the logical address by add/sub the virtual base address
 * (logical_address = virtual_address - virtual_base)
 * 3. Using the swizzle mask, obtain the node offset and the block number within
 * the node
 * 4. Obtain the physical address by adding the physical base address to the
 * node offset and the block number within the node
 *
 * ## Access Flags
 * Two bits permission field
 * 00: non-defined/invalid
 * 01: read-only
 * 10: write-only
 * 11: read-write
